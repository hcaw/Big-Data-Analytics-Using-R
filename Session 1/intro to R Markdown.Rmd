# 1. Variables

<!-- First we learnt how to create and set values to variables in R. -->

[//]:(lalal lal alk)

```{r}
x<-1
y=2
3-> z

(x+y)*z
```

# 2. Vectors

Next we learnt vectors and their operations.

```{r}
x <- c(0,1,2,3,4)
x

y <- seq(1,5)
y

y <- 1:6 
y

z<- 1: 50
z

u <- seq(0,1,length=10)
u
```

# 3. Plots

## 3.1. Embedding plots 
You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

## 3.2. Echo parameter
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot, which is following:

```{r}
plot(cars)
```
